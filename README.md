# Hi there! I'm Rizqi Kafa Muntaqa 👋

I’m a **Full-stack Developer** with a creative twist. While I spend most of my time architecting robust backends and crafting responsive frontends, my background in **UI/UX and Graphic Design** allows me to see projects through a unique lens: where technical performance meets pixel-perfect aesthetics.

I don't just write code; I build digital experiences that are intuitive, functional, and visually engaging.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

* **Development:** Building scalable web applications using **Laravel, Node.js, and React/Next.js**. I love clean architecture and efficient database design.
* **Design:** Creating user-centric interfaces in **Figma** and crafting visual identities through **Graphic Design**. I believe a product's beauty is just as important as its stability.
* **Problem Solving:** Bridging the gap between "how it looks" and "how it works." I enjoy taking a concept from a rough sketch to a fully deployed application.
